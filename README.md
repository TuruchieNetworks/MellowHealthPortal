Mellow Health Portal - Getting Started Guide.
To make the most of our application, follow these steps to set up initial data and explore various functionalities:

Step 1: Creating Essential Records
1.1 Create a Physician
Navigate to the Physician Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/PhysicianController.java) and use the provided endpoints to create at least one physician.

1.2 Create a Patient
Visit the Patients Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/PatientOperationsController/PatientsController.java) and use the available endpoints to add a patient.

1.3 Establish a Physicians-Patients Relationship
In the Physicians-Patient Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/PhysiciansPatientController.java), associate the created physician with the patient. This relationship is crucial for streamlined communication and care coordination.

Step 2: Patient Case Management
2.1 Create a Patient Case
Go to the Patient Case Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/ClinicalOperationsControllers/PatientCaseController.java) and create a patient case for the established physician-patient relationship.

Step 3: Exploring Additional Functionalities
3.1 Current Medication and Dose Regimen
Utilize the Current Medication Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/DiagnosticProceduresControllers/CurrentMedicationsController.java) to add current medication records.
Once current medications are available, proceed to the Dose Regimen Controller (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/controllers/DiagnosticProceduresControllers/DoseRegimenController.java) to set up dose regimens that depend on current medications.
3.2 Other Diagnostic Procedures
Explore other diagnostic procedures available in the Diagnostic Procedures Controllers. Each procedure might have dependencies or relationships with other records.

Step 4: Testing and Further Exploration
Now that you have set up essential records, feel free to test various functionalities. Create patient vital records, insurance information, and explore incident reporting. The robust codebase and utilities are designed to handle complex healthcare scenarios.
Remember to check the logs for any error messages, and feel free to refer to the comprehensive utils package (/src/main/java/com/turuchie/mellowhealthportal/utils) for additional support during testing.
